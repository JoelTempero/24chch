                <p>The spirit of this competition is that you go away, go nuts with your imagination for 24 hours, come back and show us whatever wild creation you've made. It's run by volunteers and just designed to be a bit of fun in between the big 48 Hours Film Festival competition times.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Rules Grid -->
            <section class="rules-section">
                <div class="rules-list">
                    <div class="rule-item">
                        <h3>What will the required elements be?</h3>
                        <p>We will announce the elements at the launch. In general, it will have some similarities to 48Hours required elements, but with our own spin on things.</p>
                        <p>What we can say is that teams will not be given a genre, so feel free to start thinking in advance about what style of film you want to make, if you like to preplan things like that.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="rule-item">
                        <h3>What if I can't be at the Friday launch event?</h3>
                        <p>Awww, that's a shame. But no worries, if you really can't be there, let us know so we're not up all night worried sick like a concerned parent. And you'll still get to find out the elements - we'll be sharing the details online shortly after the in-person launch (by 6.30pm at the latest), for everyone to see.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="rule-item">
                        <h3>So, no more than 3 minutes, huh? That's quite short, isn't it?</h3>
                        <p>Yes and no. Yes, if you're used to making 5- or even 7-minute films for 48Hours. Unless you're remembering the special 48Hours of 2020 when it was a 3-minute maximum. Good times. And if you remember that then you know exactly what we're talking about.</p>
                        <p>3 minutes is obviously shorter, which means your script should be even tighter. Keep it simple, one scene maybe, think the rhythms of sketch comedy, think music videos, find ways to be efficient with your storytelling, get rid of dialogue except where it's really necessary in your story, show don't tell. The Briscoes lady sells us a duvet, a dinnerware set and some lovely throw pillows in 30 seconds, I'm sure you can sell us something in 2-3 minutes.</p>
                        <p>But also, no, 3 minutes is still a lot of film to make. The truth is, making a 3-minute film is actually not much less work than making a 5-minute film - you still have to brainstorm, write a script, travel to locations, say "action!" lots, edit the film, maybe do some fancy titles or effects or write some nice music, it all adds up. So be prepared for that.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="rule-item">
                        <h3>How strict will you be on the duration thing?</h3>
                        <p>For starters, no such thing as too short, we're all good with 3-minute films and 3-second films. But we are totally going to enforce the high-end, strictly no longer than 3 minutes, cos we like short shorts. Well, maybe we'll let a few extra seconds go unnoticed if we're feeling generous. But! if you go a noticeable amount over 3 minutes, our tech is instructed to move on to the next one. You have been warned!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="rule-item">
                        <h3>What about music for my film? What are my options?</h3>
                        <p>If you think you're up for it, we would love to see teams create original music for their films. But let's be real, a) not everyone has the chops to do that, and b) even if you can do that, 24 hours is very little time to do it in.</p>
                        <p>Other than original music, there are free music libraries available online. Do your research in advance, read the fine-print (e.g. make sure you're only using music that is royalty-free), and be sure to include appropriate acknowledgements in your credits.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="rule-item">
                        <h3>Is there anything I can't include in my film?</h3>
                        <p>We're not prudes, and we want to respect your artistic freedom and all that. But there are obviously some lines in terms of objectionable content that we don't want crossed. Hopefully what those are should be clear, but please contact us if you're unsure which side of the line your masterpiece falls on.</p>
                        <p>We won't get a chance to properly review films prior to the screening so there's going to be a bit of trust here. But we reserve the right to cut your film off mid-screening if we feel it's inappropriate.</p>
                        <p>Upon hand-in, we will ask you whether your film contains any content unsuitable for children, eg explicit language, nudity, adult themes. This probably won't stop us from screening your film, but it will help us to programme the screening strategically and warn the audience in advance.</p>
                        <p><strong>48 Hours says this (we feel the same way): When in doubt, cut it out.</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="rule-item">
                        <h3>Am I allowed to prepare anything prior to the 24 filmmaking period?</h3>
                        <p>Great question. Ultimately this is your decision, in terms of how much you want to be restrained by the rules, versus this just being an excuse/motivation to get a film made. Either option is valid, although we would ideally like for at least the majority of your film idea and creation to be made within the 24-hour period, to preserve the spirit of the thing.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="rule-item">
                        <h3>Can I use pre-existing footage in my film?</h3>
                        <p>Again, the more that's made within the 24-hour period, the better. But if it's your own footage, all good. If it's not yours, just remember that all the usual copyright rules apply. If in doubt, don't use it.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="rule-item highlight">
                        <h3>If the rules are unclear:</h3>
                        <p>This competition is (even) less serious than our big/legitimate brother at 48 hours, so PLEASE don't get too hung up on the rules. We'd love you to delight us. Last year, somebody finished their film by cutting to live action in the theatre. Iconic.</p>
                        <p>But if you're really unsure, contact us and ask!</p>
