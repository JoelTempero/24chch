                <div class="prose">
                    <p>With the <a href="https://48hours.co.nz/" target="_blank">48HOURS Film Festival</a> taking a hiatus in 2023, Christchurch decided to take matters into their own hands and run their very own film making competition!</p>
                    <p>Starting on November 10th at Little Andromeda, filmmakers of all levels gathered to create short films, each lasting no more than three minutes. The event concluded with an exciting screening the next day, showcasing the unique and creative stories that were brought to life in just one day.</p>
                    <p>The challenge of 24CHCH23 was to make a film that included three specific elements: "12 O'Clock," "Yellow," and "A Surprise." This encouraged filmmakers to be creative and think on their feet. The tight timeframe and these unique elements brought out the best in everyone, leading to a diverse array of films. It wasn't just about making films; it was about bringing together people who share a love for storytelling and filmmaking.</p>
                    <p>A massive thank you to Michael Bell and Scott Koorey for running the competition! And thanks to our sponsors for hosting and donating prizes.</p>

                        <h3>When is this happening?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Friday 27th and Saturday 28th March 2026</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>I'm interested! Tell me more!</h3>
                        <p>All you need is just one day's commitment to make a movie, celebrate local filmmaking, and get to hang out with this awesome Christchurch community.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
                        <p>Nothing! It's absolutely free to enter. The only cost will be a small amount ($15, or $5 concession) for tickets to the screening. And a USB memory stick, but I'm sure you can find one down the back of your computer desk and we'll give it back at the end of the night.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Will there be required elements for the film?</h3>
                        <p>At the launch, there will be three required elements given which you have to include in your short film.</p>
                        <p><strong>There are no assigned genres, make whatever film you like!</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>I'm in! Where do I sign up?</h3>
                        <p>Go to the front page of this website to register interest! And we'll notify all registered people closer to the time to confirm your entry!</p>
                        <p>This event is intended specifically for the Christchurch community, and the in-person aspects of the event (i.e. launch, hand-in, screening and awards) are a big part of what it's all about.</p>
                        <p>That said, if you're from Christchurch or the general Canterbury area (or at least have some meaningful connection to the place) and you want to participate but you'll be out-of-town on the weekend in question, you are most welcome to get involved remotely. We will consider out-of-town registrations on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Are the 48Hours organisers okay with this?</h3>
                        <p>Yes! This is an Ōtautahi organised event with the blessing of our gorilla filmmaking overlords in Te Ika-a-Māui. And who knows, maybe this could be a 'gateway drug' for introducing new budding CHCH filmmakers to the wonderful world of 48Hours…</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>I've done 48Hours before - will this be pretty much the same?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Yes:</strong> you're on a deadline, you've got elements to include, you probably won't get much sleep.</p>
                        <p><strong>No:</strong> it's half the time for starters, and that's a pretty huge difference. Also, no official judging, and the rules are maybe a bit more bendy than 48Hours. Less competition, more yay let's make a film and show it to friends.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>I've never done 48Hours before!</h3>
                        <p>Great! In that case, ignore most of what we've just rambled on about comparing this event to 48Hours in the previous answers. We welcome all spring chickens into the fold.</p>
